In this project we will build a song recommendation engine. The user will input one song and will receive five recommendations for songs to play.

# 1. Chosing the features

First we start by loading all the relevant libraries.


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
```

Now we load the dataset we will use.


```python
# Load the dataset
file_path = '~/Documents/Data sets/Spotify-2000.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Display a summary of the dataset
print(df.describe())

# Display the column names to identify the features
print(df.columns)
```

           'Speechiness', 'Popularity'],
          dtype='object')


Finally we select the features we want to consider for the recommendation system, drop the missing values of the dataset, and normalize the values of the features so that they are presented in equivalent scales.


```python
# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Feature selection
features = ['Energy', 'Danceability', 'Liveness', 'Valence', 'Acousticness', 'Speechiness']
X = df[features]

# Normalize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

# 2. Visualizing the data


```python
# Plot the distribution of each variable
for feature in features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(df[feature], kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.show()

# Visualizing the normalized data (optional)
normalized_df = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=features)
for feature in features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(normalized_df[feature], kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Normalized Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.show()
```

As we can see the distribution of energy is slightly left-skewed, which show that most songs have between 60 and 80 of energy. Danceability follows a more normal distribution with a mean around 50. Liveness is strongly right-skewed, which could be interpreted as that most songs in the database don't have a lot of liveness. Valence is a sligly flat, left-skewed distribution. Acousticness shows a big spike close to the 0-10 range, meaning that most of the songs in the data base are not Acoustic.

It definately makes sense to normalize that data to ensure that there is some level of equivalence among features.

# 3. Principal Component Analysis

Now we can perform a principal component analysis of only 2 components.


```python
# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Create a DataFrame with the principal components
pca_df = pd.DataFrame(data=principal_components, columns=['Principal Component 1', 'Principal Component 2'])

# Visualize the coefficients of the first two principal components
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
components = pd.DataFrame(pca.components_, columns=features, index=['Principal Component 1', 'Principal Component 2'])
sns.heatmap(components.T, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('PCA Coefficients')
plt.xlabel('Principal Components')
plt.ylabel('Features')
plt.show()

# Visualize the first two principal components in a 2D scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='Principal Component 1', y='Principal Component 2', data=pca_df)
plt.title('2D Scatter Plot of the First Two Principal Components')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.show()
```

As we can see the fist principal component has higher coefficients for Energy, Valence, Speechiness, and Liveness; and the second principal component has higher coefficients for Dansability, and Acoustcness. Which could be interpreted as that the components are dividing the songs between those that have more lyrics and are more energitic, and those that have more melodies and are more for dancing. A 2x2 scatter plot shows that the observations are fairly evenly distributed across the two principal components.


```python
# Identify the songs with the highest and lowest values for the 1st principal component
highest_pc1_index = pca_df['Principal Component 1'].idxmax()
lowest_pc1_index = pca_df['Principal Component 1'].idxmin()

highest_pc1_song = df.iloc[highest_pc1_index]
lowest_pc1_song = df.iloc[lowest_pc1_index]

print("Song with the highest value for the 1st principal component:")
print(highest_pc1_song)
print("\nSong with the lowest value for the 1st principal component:")
print(lowest_pc1_song)

# Identify the songs with the highest and lowest values for the 2nd principal component
highest_pc2_index = pca_df['Principal Component 2'].idxmax()
lowest_pc2_index = pca_df['Principal Component 2'].idxmin()

highest_pc2_song = df.iloc[highest_pc2_index]
lowest_pc2_song = df.iloc[lowest_pc2_index]

print("\nSong with the highest value for the 2nd principal component:")
print(highest_pc2_song)
print("\nSong with the lowest value for the 2nd principal component:")
print(lowest_pc2_song)
```

    Song with the highest value for the 1st principal component:

As we can see the top song in the first principal component is "Empire State Of Mind" by Jay-Z, a song with high energy and a lot of lyrics. And the lowest rated song in that component is "Theme from Harry's Game" by Clannad, which is a celtic song. For the second component, the highest song is "Kingston Town" by UB40, and the lowest is "Limburg - Live" by Rowwen HÃ¨ze. In that sense we could see that the fist component is reflecting a little bit more the lyrics, and the second is reflecting the melodies.

# 4. Recommendation System

Let's first try to create the function calculating the distance over the 6 feautures.


```python
# Function to recommend songs using Euclidean distance
def recommend_songs(index_value, num_recommendations=5):
    # Find the row index for the given 'Index' column value
    song_index = df[df['Index'] == index_value].index[0]
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distances between the selected song and all other songs
    distances = cdist(X_scaled[song_index].reshape(1, -1), X_scaled, metric='euclidean').flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the closest songs (excluding the selected song itself)
    closest_indices = distances.argsort()[1:num_recommendations+1]
    
    # Print the input song details
    input_song = df.iloc[song_index]
    print(f"Input Song: {input_song['Title']} by {input_song['Artist']}\n")
    
    # Print the recommended songs
    print("Recommended Songs:")
    for idx in closest_indices:
        recommended_song = df.iloc[idx]
        print(f"{recommended_song['Title']} by {recommended_song['Artist']}")
    
    # Return the recommended songs
    return df.iloc[closest_indices]

# Test the recommendation engine
sample_song_index_value = 10  # Replace with the 'Index' value of the song you want to use as input
recommendations = recommend_songs(sample_song_index_value)
print(recommendations)
```

Finaly, I creaded the recommendation function, using eucliden distance to find the closest 5 neighboors of the selected song. I tested it with "Without Me" by Eminem, and the recommendations were Jump Around by House Of Pain, I Will Survive - Single Version by Gloria Gaynor, 24K Magic by Bruno Mars, Major Tom by Peter Schilling, 1999 by Prince. I would say they are fairly good recommendations. I will now try to calculate the distance over only the two principal components.


```python
# Function to recommend songs using Euclidean distance on principal components
def recommend_songs(index_value, num_recommendations=5):
    # Find the row index for the given 'Index' column value
    song_index = df[df['Index'] == index_value].index[0]
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distances between the selected song and all other songs using principal components
    distances = cdist(pca_df.iloc[song_index].values.reshape(1, -1), pca_df, metric='euclidean').flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the closest songs (excluding the selected song itself)
    closest_indices = distances.argsort()[1:num_recommendations+1]
    
    # Print the input song details
    input_song = df.iloc[song_index]
    print(f"Input Song: {input_song['Title']} by {input_song['Artist']}\n")
    
    # Print the recommended songs
    print("Recommended Songs:")
    for idx in closest_indices:
        recommended_song = df.iloc[idx]
        print(f"{recommended_song['Title']} by {recommended_song['Artist']}")
    
    # Return the recommended songs
    return df.iloc[closest_indices]

# Test the recommendation engine
sample_song_index_value = 10  # Replace with the 'Index' value of the song you want to use as input
recommendations = recommend_songs(sample_song_index_value)
print(recommendations)
```

```python
Only using the principal component to estimate the distance did not work that well, as I did not know any of the recommended songs in this case. I guess it can proabily be because using only 2 components is not capturing enough complexity of the data to find a good recommendation.
```

# 5. Extra work

## 5.A. Recommendation Fuction including popularity

First I am going to run the recommendation system using the 6 features, and adding popularity.


```python
# Function to recommend songs using Euclidean distance and sort by popularity
def recommend_songs_with_popularity(index_value, num_recommendations=5):
    # Find the row index for the given 'Index' column value
    song_index = df[df['Index'] == index_value].index[0]
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distances between the selected song and all other songs
    distances = cdist(X_scaled[song_index].reshape(1, -1), X_scaled, metric='euclidean').flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the closest songs (excluding the selected song itself)
    closest_indices = distances.argsort()[1:num_recommendations+1]
    
    # Print the input song details
    input_song = df.iloc[song_index]
    print(f"Input Song: {input_song['Title']} by {input_song['Artist']}\n")
    
    # Print the recommended songs
    print("Recommended Songs:")
    recommended_songs = df.iloc[closest_indices]
    recommended_songs = recommended_songs.sort_values(by='Popularity', ascending=False)
    for idx, song in recommended_songs.iterrows():
        print(f"{song['Title']} by {song['Artist']} (Popularity: {song['Popularity']})")
    
    # Return the recommended songs
    return recommended_songs

# Test the recommendation engine with popularity
recommendations_with_popularity = recommend_songs_with_popularity(sample_song_index_value)
print(recommendations_with_popularity)

As we can see, I got the same results as before, but just in a different order. I will try to find the distance using the 2 first principal components and then adding popularity.


```python
# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Normalize the popularity feature
popularity_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Popularity']])

# Combine the principal components and the normalized popularity feature
combined_features = pd.DataFrame(principal_components, columns=['Principal Component 1', 'Principal Component 2'])
combined_features['Popularity'] = popularity_scaled

# Function to recommend songs using Euclidean distance on principal components and popularity
def recommend_songs(index_value, num_recommendations=5):
    # Find the row index for the given 'Index' column value
    song_index = df[df['Index'] == index_value].index[0]
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distances between the selected song and all other songs using combined features
    distances = cdist(combined_features.iloc[song_index].values.reshape(1, -1), combined_features, metric='euclidean').flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the closest songs (excluding the selected song itself)
    closest_indices = distances.argsort()[1:num_recommendations+1]
    
    # Print the input song details
    input_song = df.iloc[song_index]
    print(f"Input Song: {input_song['Title']} by {input_song['Artist']}\n")
    
    # Print the recommended songs
    print("Recommended Songs:")
    for idx in closest_indices:
        recommended_song = df.iloc[idx]
        print(f"{recommended_song['Title']} by {recommended_song['Artist']}")
    
    # Return the recommended songs
    return df.iloc[closest_indices]

# Test the recommendation engine

Now I feel this recommendation system is much better as I do like a lot all the recommended songs and feel that they are similar to the index song that I used. I guess if there was a third principal component it would be very similar to popularity, because it seems that it is capturing a lot of the signal needed to find a good recommendation.

## 5.B Principal Components Analysis from Scratch

def pca_from_scratch(X, n_components=2):
    # Standardize the data
    X_meaned = X - np.mean(X, axis=0)
    
    # Compute the covariance matrix
    cov_matrix = np.cov(X_meaned, rowvar=False)
    
    # Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(cov_matrix)
    
    # Sort eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    sorted_index = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
    sorted_eigenvalues = eigenvalues[sorted_index]
    sorted_eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, sorted_index]
    
    # Select the top n_components eigenvectors
    eigenvector_subset = sorted_eigenvectors[:, 0:n_components]
    
    # Project the data onto principal components
    X_reduced = np.dot(eigenvector_subset.transpose(), X_meaned.transpose()).transpose()
    
    return X_reduced

# Perform PCA from scratch
X_reduced_scratch = pca_from_scratch(X_scaled, n_components=2)
print(X_reduced_scratch)
